1.CREATE TABLE: Creates an Employees table with columns for EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, and Salary.
  
  CREATE TABLE employees (empId int PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1000,1), firstName varchar(20) NOT NULL, LastName varchar(20) NOT NULL, Dept varchar(20) NOT NULL, salary decimal(10,2) CHECK (salary > 0));


2.INSERT: Adds three employee records to the table.
  
  INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1001, 'Virat', 'Kohli', 'Marketing', 2000);
  INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1002, 'Christiano', 'Ronaldo', 'IT', 3000);
  INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1003, 'Rohit', 'Sharma', 'IT', 1000);


3.Select all columns and rows

  SELECT * FROM employees;


4.Select specific columns
  
  SELECT firstName,salary FROM employees;

5.Select with a WHERE clause to filter results
  
  SELECT firstName,salary FROM employees WHERE empId=1001;

6.What is the purpose of the IDENTITY keyword in the CREATE TABLE statement?

  Used to add autoincrement property to a column


7.Write a SELECT statement to retrieve only the FirstName and Salary of all employees.

  SELECT firstName,salary FROM employees;

8.How would you modify the existing UPDATE statement to give all employees in the IT department a 10% raise

  UPDATE employees set salary = salary*1.1 where Dept = 'IT';


9.Write a SELECT statement to find the highest salary in the Employees table
  
  SELECT max(salary) FROM employees;


10.How would you add a new column named "HireDate" of type DATE to the Employees table?

  ALTER TABLE employees ADD (HireDate DATE);


11.Write an INSERT statement to add a new employee named "Sarah Brown" in the "Marketing" department with a salary of 72000.00.

  INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1004,'Sarah','Brown','Marketing',72000.00,'2025-10-16')


12.How would you modify the table to ensure that the Salary column cannot contain negative values?
  
  ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT salary_positive CHECK(salary>=0)


13.How would you add a UNIQUE constraint to the Employees table to ensure that no two employees can have the same email address

  ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT unique_salary UNIQUE(salary)


14.How would you add a UNIQUE constraint to the Employees table to ensure that no two employees can have the same email address
  
  ALTER TABLE employees ADD email varchar(100)

  UPDATE employees 
	SET email =
        CASE empId
            When 1001 THEN 'virat@gmail.com'
            When 1002 THEN 'cr7@gmail.com'
            when 1003 then 'rohit@gmail.com'
            when 1004 then 'sarah@gmail.com'
        END
	Where email IS NULL

  ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email UNIQUE(email)

15.Write an ALTER TABLE statement to add an "Email" column to the Employees table with a UNIQUE constraint that allows NULL values
  
  CREATE UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX nullfilter 
  ON employees(email) 
  WHERE email IS NOT NULL
